## About the language

> _Describe the language_
>
> - Rust first appeared in 2010
> - C/C++ offers more control while offering less safety, Python offers less control while offering more safety
> - Rust offers more control AND more safety
> - Rust closely resembles C/C++ in terms of code syntax

## About the syntax

> _give some code snippet of the language_

*Let form*

```rust
fn main(){
	let let_x = 5;
	let let_y = 9;

	println!("The sum of x and y is {}", let_x + let_y);
}
```

## About the tools

> _Describe the compiler or interpreter needed_.
> _To run rust, the compiler rustc is required._.
> _When a rust file is compiled with rustc, an executable file is produced_.
> _Ordinarily however, project files will be created and run using cargo_.
> -cargo new hello-world
> -cargo build
> -cargo run

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

## About open source library

> _Describe at least one contribution by the open source
community written in the language._

# Analysis of the language

> _Organize your report according to the project description
document_.
